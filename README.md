This is an implementation of Taser Shoes: The Game as an online arena.

Currently only locally playable but should only need a bit of work to get fully working

## Running the Game

With cargo installed run `cargo run` to build and run the server. Navitate to
https://localhost:8080` in two browsers to play against each other.
